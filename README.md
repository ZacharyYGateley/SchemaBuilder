# SchemaBuilder

This is a simple JavaScript library that creates independent floating panels that can be dragged and dropped with the mouse (via mouse events) or the finger (via press events).

It can either create DOM elements from scratch (see example_create.html) or make an existing DOM element a floating panel in the topmost DOM element (see example_existing.html).

While this may serve a purpose for somebody as an includable library, it is more a demonstration of good JavaScript coding practices and can be used to learn some more intermediate to advanced JavaScript usages.
